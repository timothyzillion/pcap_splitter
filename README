Quick and dirty program for splitting PCAP files by "session" defined
by the five tuple <src-IP, dst-IP, protocol, src-port, dst-port> (only
valid for TCP and UDP, will automatically filter everything else out.

Dependencies: libpcap, stl, ??

The current version keeps its files open -- so it will potentially
open a lot of files. The advantage of this, is that none of the
packets are held in memory (so the memory footprint is very small).

The intent of the design is to embed vectors of packets in the
sessions, and then use some eviction policy to flush those out to the
files; and to only open the files for the duration of the eviction of
a particular vector of packets. Shouldn't be more than an hour or so
of work to get the more scaleable version running.
